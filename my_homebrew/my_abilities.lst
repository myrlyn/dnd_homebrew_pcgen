#insert your data here

#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Feat File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the feats file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
# Abilities are the newest method for all aspects of class & race abilities. Currently we use hidden feats to emulate
# class and racial abilities. The advent of Abilities allows us to use one standard format for a variety of things.
# Generally Abilities are exactly the same in format as a Feat with the exception of a NEW tag CATEGORY which tells
# PCGen what the ability is to be categoried as - example: My Ability is part of the my_abilities category, So I can add
# points only to the my_abilities allowing very small and restricted lists. Another example would be Fighter Bonus feats.
#
# Feat and ability are used through out this example as they almost the same thing - ABILITY can also be used to add "Feats"
# using the CATEGORY:FEAT tag.
# You can also use PREFEAT for any CATEGORY:FEAT, for the rest you'll need to use PREABILITY:x,CATEGORY=<category>,Foo,TYPE.Bar (x is the number)
#####1st Example

#####
#Each ability takes one line, just like a feat, and the first field must be the abilities' name. In the Example the name of the ability is My Ability.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names abilities which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat/ability Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the ability/feat is.
#
#The DESC tag is used to hold the description of the Ability/Feat. In our files we usually keep the description brief, so the user
#still need to own the book to make use of the data, but for your personal files can get as elaborate as you want there.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a ability/feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the feat. This will be displayed in PCGen.

Death Attack							KEY:Avenger ~ Death Attack					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																				DEFINE:DeathAttackDC|0	DEFINE:DeathAttackDC|0																	DESC:If an Avenger studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (Avenger's choice). While studying the victim, the Avenger can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the Avenger or recognize the Avenger as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the Avenger's class level + the Avenger's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering her helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the Avenger. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the Avenger has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the Avenger does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.

Poison Use								KEY:Avenger ~ Poison Use					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																												DESC:Avengers are trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.181
Spells								KEY:Avenger ~ Spells						CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																												DESC:Beginning at 1st level, an Avenger gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. to cast a spell, an Avenger must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an Avenger with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Avenger bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the Avenger's Intelligence bonus (if any). When the Avenger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level Avenger), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The Avenger's spell list appears below. An Avenger casts spells just as a bard does. Upon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an Avenger can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level Avenger spell the Avenger can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, an Avenger could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highestlevel sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1stlevel spell. At 8th and 10th levels, he could trade in a single 1stlevel or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level Avenger spells) for a different spell of the same level. An Avenger may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.

Save Bonus against Poison					KEY:Avenger ~ Save Bonus against Poison			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Class Feature.Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																		DEFINE:AvengerPoisonSaveBonus|0	DEFINE:AvengerPoisonSaveBonus|0													DESC:Avengers train with poisons of all types and slowly grow more and more resistant to their effects. This is reflected by a natural saving throw bonus to all poisons gained at 2nd level that increases by +1 for every two additional levels the Avenger gains (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 6th level, and so on).

Uncanny Dodge							KEY:Avenger ~ Uncanny Dodge					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Uncanny Dodge																																																										DESC:Starting at 2nd level, an Avenger gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.) If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																								BONUS:VAR|UncannyDodgeFlankingLevel|AvengerLVL|TYPE=EachClass.REPLACE																																																																																											SOURCEPAGE:p.181
Improved Uncanny Dodge						KEY:Avenger ~ Improved Uncanny Dodge			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality.Uncanny Dodge																																																										DESC:At 5th level, an Avenger can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the Avenger. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the Avenger can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																	SOURCEPAGE:p.181
Hide in Plain Sight						KEY:Avenger ~ Hide in Plain Sight				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.Class Feature.Avenger Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																																										DESC:At 8th level, an Avenger can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an Avenger can hide himself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.

Great Swing	KEY:War Hulk ~ Great Swing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.War Hulk Class Feature.SpecialAttack	DESC:Starting at 2nd level, a war hulk is able to make a great, sweeping swing with a melee weapon. As a full-round action, the war hulk can choose three squares adjacent to one another (he must threaten all of them). His attack applies to all creatures in those squares. Make one attack roll and apply that roll as an attack against each defender. If the war hulk uses a special attack (such as disarm, trip, or sunder), this special attack affects only the first target; the other creatures are attacked normally.  Walls and similar obstacles can block a great swing. Start with one square that the war hulk threatens. Each successive square chosen must be adjacent to the previous square and have line of effect from that square. Two squares separated by a wall, for instance, can’t be chosen as adjacent squares for a great swing. The war hulk may skip creatures, attacking only those he wants to. For example, if there are three creatures in a row—an enemy, an ally, and another enemy—the war hulk can choose those three squares for the great swing but strike only the two enemies. If a war hulk drops one of his foes with a great swing, he may make a cleave attack normally. However, he may do so only once for every time he swings, even if he drops more than one foe.

Mighty Rock Throwing	KEY:War Hulk ~ Mighty Rock Throwing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.War Hulk Class Feature.SpecialAttack	DESC:Starting at 3rd level, a war hulk gains a powerful rock throwing ability. The character can throw rocks that deal 2d8 points of damage with a range increment of 50 feet. (Like all thrown weapons, they have a maximum range of five range increments.) The war hulk uses his Strength modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier on the attack roll. The rock must weigh approximately 50 pounds.

Mighty Swing	KEY:War Hulk ~ Mighty Swing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.War Hulk Class Feature.SpecialAttack	DESC:Starting at 4th level, a war hulk can make a mighty swing. A mighty swing is like a great swing, except that it is an attack rather than a full-round action. Thus, the character can move and make a mighty swing or (if he can make multiple attacks) make multiple mighty swings in a single round.

Sweeping Boulder	KEY:War Hulk ~ Sweeping Boulder	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.War Hulk Class Feature.SpecialAttack	DESC: Starting at 6th level, a war hulk is able to throw his rocks with such force that they affect two adjacent squares. (The second square must be farther away from the war hulk than the first—they cannot be equidistant from him.) Make one attack roll and apply the result to each target. As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from one square to the next.


Toughness	KEY:War Hulk ~ Tougness	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.War Hulk Class Feature.SpecialQuality	DESC:You gain the Tougness feat		 ABILITY:FEAT|VIRTUAL|Toughness	CHOOSE:NOCHOICE	MULT:YES	STACK:YES


Massive Sweeping Boulder	KEY:War Hulk ~ Massive Sweeping Boulder	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.War Hulk Class Feature.SpecialAttack	DESC: Starting at 8th level, a war hulk is able to throw his rocks with such force that they affect four squares in a line. (Each successive square chosen must be farther away from the character.) Only the first creature can be subject to damage from a critical hit or a sneak attack.  As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from one square to the next


Massive Swing	KEY:War Hulk ~ Massive Swing	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Extraordinary.Class Feature.War Hulk Class Feature.SpecialAttack	DESC: A 10th-level war hulk can lash out all around himself with a single attack. Massive swing works like mighty swing, except that its effect is not limited to three squares. The war hulk’s swing affects all squares he threatens.

A kobold requires no one else to perform the rite; it is a solitary activity.	DESC:The Greater Draconic Rite of Passage is a powerful ritual handed down from dragons to kobolds as a reward for their undying loyalty. In the same way that chromatic and metallic dragons gain integrated levels of sorcerer spellcasting as they age, this ritual allows kobolds to awaken a small amount of their own arcane might.	BONUS:HP|CURRENTMAX|-3	ADD:SPELLCASTER|Sorcerer	COST:0	BENEFIT:Upon completing this rite, a kobold gains new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if also gaining one level in the sorcerer class. The kobold does not, however, gain any other benefit a sorcerer would have gained (familiar abilities, and so on). The benefit of this ritual is automatically factored into the 15 minutes that a kobold sorcerer spends concentrating to ready their daily allotment of spells. No kobold can benefit from this rite more than once. Time: A kobold who undergoes this rite must first endure nine days of fasting (the equivalent of three days for a kobold in a region above 40 degrees F). Immediately thereafter, the kobold must succeed on a DC 20 Concentration check to enter a deep trance that lasts for 24 hours. If the check fails, the rite must begin a new. Cost: This rite requires sacrificing a gem of at least 1,000 gp in value. The kobold also permanently loses 3 hit points upon completion of the rite, the price of unlocking latent draconic energy within their soul.

Unarmed Strike			KEY:Battle Dancer ~ Unarmed Strike			SOURCEPAGE:p.41	CATEGORY:Internal	TYPE:Class Feature.Battle Dancer Class Feature.SpecialQuality																																			DESC:Battle Dancers are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so. At 1st level, a Battle Dancer gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A Battle Dancer's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a Battle Dancer may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a Battle Dancer striking unarmed. A Battle Dancer may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes. Usually a Battle Dancer's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. A Battle Dancer's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons (such as the magic fang and magic weapon spells). A Battle Dancer also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table 3-10: The Battle Dancer. The unarmed damage on Table 3-10 is for Medium Battle Dancers. A Small Battle Dancer deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large Battle Dancer deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Battle Dancer Unarmed Damage.

Slight Build			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Race Trait.Kobold.Kobold Race Trait.Racial.Kobold Racial Trait.Racial Trait	DESC:You count as 1 size smaller when beneficial.		BENEFIT:The physical stature of kobolds lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category smaller. Whenever a kobold is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as Hide), the kobold is treated as one size smaller if doing so is advantageous to the character. A kobold is also considered to be one size smaller when "squeezing" through a restrictive space. A kobold can use weapons designed for a creature one size smaller without penalty. However, the space and reach of a kobold remain those of a creature of their actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject's size category.

You gain the same bonus on Survival checks made to track such creatures.

Trophy		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Supernatural.SpecialQuality.ClassFeature	DESC:You have the ability to wear your enemy and protect yourself from its power. Whenever you slay a Huge or larger aberration, animal, dragon, or magical beast, you can take a body part as atrophy, such as a horn, tooth, or claw. You must have dealt damage to the creature in the encounter that killed it (you can't just watch the wizard blast it and then claim the trophy), and you must harvest the trophy within 1 minute of the creature's death. You must then treat the trophy with a mixture of precious oils and magical preservatives costing at least 500 gp. This process takes 24 hours.  When worn, a trophy grants you a +2 competence bonus to AC and on saves against all creatures of that type. For instance, wearing the claw of a red dragon grants you the bonus against the attacks of red dragons (but not other kinds of dragons).  At 5th level, the bonus to AC and saving throws improves to +4.  A trophy works only for the leviathan hunter who created it. Although you can create many trophies, you can benefit from the effects of no more than one trophy per class level. Simultaneously wearing more trophies than this negates the effects of all trophies.		ASPECT:NAME|Trophy (+%1)|TrophyBonus

Goliaths can make standing long jumps and high Jumps as if they were running long jumps and high Jumps. A goliath can engage in accelerated climbing (climbing half his speed as a move action) without taking the -5 penalty on the Climb check.

	
CATEGORY=Special Ability|Goliath ~ Powerful Build.MOD		DESC:The physical stature of a goliath let's him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger. Whenever a goliath is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the goliath is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to him. A goliath is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A goliath can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size.
