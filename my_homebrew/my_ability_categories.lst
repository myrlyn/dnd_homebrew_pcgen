#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up
#your own data. Remember not to put the '#' at the start of your own data, as PCGen would see it as a comment only.
#
#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Feat File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the feats file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical
#listing of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#

#
# Ability Categories
#Example of a SuperSet or Parent
#ABILITYCATEGORY:Special Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	EDITABLE:YES	EDITPOOL:NO	FRACTIONALPOOL:NO	VISIBLE:NO
#ABILITYCATEGORY:AbilitybySkill	CATEGORY:AbilitybySkill		EDITABLE:YES	EDITPOOL:NO	FRACTIONALPOOL:NO	POOL:AbilitybySkillPool		VISIBLE:QUALIFY	PLURAL:AbilitybySkills
# No TYPE and Matching ABILITYCATEGORY and CATEGORY names designates these as SUPERSET/PARENT.



#Examples of a Subset or Child
#ABILITYCATEGORY:My Class Ability	CATEGORY:Special Ability	EDITABLE:YES	EDITPOOL:NO	FRACTIONALPOOL:NO	VISIBLE:QUALIFY	TYPE:MyClass	DISPLAYLOCATION:Class Abilities	PLURAL:My Class Abilities

# VISIBLE TAG will take YES, NO or QUALIFY - QUALIFY won't display the Category unless it has one valid selection or the number is 1 or higher in the pool.
# New tag - DISPLAYLOCATION:<user defined> will allow you to group ABILITIES together in the same "tab"
# New tag - DISPLAYNAME:<user defined> serves the same function as OUTPUTNAME is showing what is displayed
# Using TYPE will populate the category with any ABILITY with a matching type. Example:
# ABILITYCATEGORY:Fighter Feats	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Fighter
# That will make all the Feats with TYPE:Fighter appear
# The POOL tag allows you to set a variable that will be added to the pool, this must be a valid variable DEFINEd or hardcoded elsewhere

# DONE
