#Every line that starts with a '#' is a comment. You may want to remove these comments, if you use this file to set up

#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Equipment File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the races file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical listing
#of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
#
#
#
#####1st Example



#####
#
#####2nd Example

#Saddlebags		TYPE:Goods.Container.Mount.Resizable		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Any=UNLIM	COST:4	WT:8		SOURCEPAGE:Equipment

#####
#The Dagger is an Example of a weapon, while the Saddlebags is an item that is set up to be used as a container for other
#items. The first field is the item's name and is required.
#
#The PROFICIENCY tag is only used with weapons, armor and shields. It tells PCGen what Weapon Proficiency name to use from the weapprofs.lst, armorprofs.lst or shieldprofs.lst file.
#
#The TYPE tag is used for many filtering and PRExxx tags. TYPE:Armor items should also have the type of SLOTS it uses. This
#is usually TYPE:Suit. TYPE:Container is a special type name. It activates the CONTAINS tag in the item. Every TYPE:Weapon
#item must be also have either TYPE:Melee or TYPE:Ranged (TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Foo). TYPE:Double is a special weapon tag. It
#activates three ALTxxx tags for the second head statistics.
#
#The CONTAINS tag is used to define how much and what a container can hold. Any object with CONTAINS must also be TYPE:Container
#for the CONTAINS tag to be activated.
#
#The COST tag sets the cost of the item.
#
#The WT tag is holding the item's weight.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the item. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#CRITMULT, CRITRANGE, DAMAGE, WIELD, and RANGE are tags that are associated with weapons. They can be used to set up the
#various weapon stats.

#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Item. F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,
#C=Colossal.

#The EQMOD tag calls an equipment modifier to be applied to the base item before looking at other tags. You will need to use
#the equipment modifier's KEY with this tag, not it's name.

#These slippers imbue the wearer with a shocking grace and a deadly fluidity in battle. Description: These soft, open-toed slippers are made of supple leather and look very comfortable.
#Activation: This item is continuously active while worn, provided that the wearer’s armor is no heavier than light. No action on the wearer’s part is required to gain the effect.
#Effect: While these slippers are on the wearer’s feet, he moves with unnatural grace and alacrity, gaining an enhancement bonus of +10 feet to his land speed. The slippers also grant him a +5 competence bonus on Tumble checks. A wearer who has at least 5 ranks in Perform (dance) accesses the true benefit of the slippers of battledancing. As long as he uses his base land speed to move (a fl y, swim, burrowing, or climb speed), he gains a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks. If he moves at least 10 feet as part of a move action, he can use his Charisma modifier instead of his Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack rolls and damage rolls with one-handed or light weapons (both melee and ranged).

#Whip-dagger		SPROP:A character who takes the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (whip) feat is also proficient in the whip-dagger. Unlike standard whips, the whip-dagger's ability to deal damage is unhindered by armor bonuses and natural armor bonuses. Although you keep it in hand, the whip-dagger is treated as a ranged weapon with a maximum range of 15 feet and no range penalties. Because the whip-dagger can wrap around an enemy's leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the whip dagger to avoid being tripped. You get a +2 bonus on your opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed yourself if you fail to disarm your opponent).supplement/arms_and_equipment/ae_profs_weapon.lst:Whip-dagger                           TYPE:Exotic.Ranged.Slashing

Shellcraft Manakin			KEY:Shellcraft Manakin		SOURCEPAGE:Ghostwalk		TYPE:Shellcraft		WT:80		COST:250		EQMOD:WOOD		DESC:This humanoid creation of metal and wood roughly resembles a tailor’s dummy, with articulated limbs and head. The unusual materials in its construction allow an incorporeal creature to enter the manikin (a standard action) and move it in a manner similar to how some ghosts can possess bodies, allowing a ghost to carry material objects even when outside the Manifest Ward. Leaving the manikin is a standard action.  A ghost uses its own ability scores when inhabiting a manikin. However, because a manikin is less effi- cient than a true body, a ghost operating a manikin takes penalties similar to those from wearing armor. An inhabited manikin has a maximum Dex bonus of +2 and an armor check penalty of –5. A ghost proficient in medium armor ignores these penalties. A manikin can wear armor just as a normal character can; a ghost inhabiting such a manikin uses the smaller maximum Dex bonus of the two and adds together the armor check penalties.  If the ghost is subject to attacks that would normally not harm an incorporeal creature, the attacks affect the manikin instead. Attacks that do not harm the ghost because of its incorporeal miss chance do affect the manikin. A manikin may be built in the form of a dwarf, elf, gnome, half-orc, halfling, or human. A manikin has hardness 7 and 50 hit points if it is Medium-size, or 35 hit points if it is Small.
